# Welcome to The Merge Repository

We believe in building the future we wanna live while enjoying life. We are group of hacker friends based in Argentina building stuff and trying to record what we learn.

> Thoughts are like tweets, we share what we think.
> Blog is our second brain, we write what we learn.
> GitHub is our storage, we code what we solve.

You are able to contribute in our GitHub, cause we believe in an open source world.

Good luck.
